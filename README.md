## About

Welcome to Carbonable Soulbound Certification and Badges, an open-source project that aims to build a decentralized, transparent, and verifiable system for certifying carbon offsetting and climate impact achievements on the blockchain.

Our project is built on the Carbonable protocol and makes use of StarkNet's tools to enable on-chain certifications and recognitions. It covers a wide range of use cases, from official certifications from carbon credit certifiers, to recognizing good practices such as reducing emissions and optimizing code for energy consumption.

With Carbonable Soulbound Certification and Badges, you can:

Certify your carbon offsetting and climate impact achievements on the blockchain
Earn badges for your contributions to carbon neutrality and the fight against climate change
Share your certifications and badges with others, increasing transparency and accountability
Verify the authenticity of certifications and badges through the use of smart contracts
This project is still in an experimental phase, and we are constantly working to improve and optimize it. We welcome any feedback and contributions to help us make it the best it can be.

To get started, please refer to our documentation and check out our open issues for a list of proposed features and known issues.

Thank you for your interest in Carbonable Soulbound Certification and Badges and we look forward to building a better future together.
